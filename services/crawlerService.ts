    text: `Emergency custody in Alabama is governed by Title 30, Chapter 3 of the Alabama Code. 
    In cases where there is an immediate threat to a child's safety or welfare, a parent or guardian may petition the court for emergency custody.
    The petitioner must demonstrate that the child is in danger of immediate and irreparable harm.
    The court may grant an ex parte order without notice to the other party if the situation warrants immediate action.
    A full hearing must be scheduled within 10 days of the emergency order.
    The best interests of the child standard is applied in all custody determinations.
    Factors considered include the child's age, health, emotional ties to each parent, and any history of domestic violence.
    Emergency orders are temporary and subject to modification after a full hearing where both parties can present evidence.`

    title: "Child Custody Modification in Alabama",
    url: "https://alabamalegalaid.org/custody-modification",
    text: `To modify an existing custody order in Alabama, the petitioning party must demonstrate a material change in circumstances since the last order was issued.
    The change must be substantial and affect the welfare of the child.
    Alabama courts apply the McLendon standard, which requires the petitioning parent to show that the positive good brought about by the change would more than offset the inherently disruptive effect of uprooting the child.
    This is a higher standard than the initial "best interests" determination.
    The court will consider factors such as the child's age, stability of each parent's home, and the child's relationship with each parent.
    Modification proceedings begin with filing a petition in the court that issued the original order.
    Both parents will have the opportunity to present evidence at a hearing.
    Temporary modifications may be granted in emergency situations pending a final hearing.`

    text: `The Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) is responsible for investigating reports of child abuse and neglect.
    Reports can be made anonymously through the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline at 1-800-252-1470.
    Upon receiving a report, DHR will assess the situation and determine if an investigation is warranted.
    Investigations typically begin within 24 hours for serious cases.
    DHR caseworkers will interview the child, parents, and other relevant individuals.
    If immediate danger is identified, DHR may seek court approval for emergency removal of the child.
    Parents have the right to legal representation during DHR proceedings.
    DHR must make reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify families when safe and appropriate.
    Case plans are developed to address identified issues and may include services such as parenting classes, counseling, or substance abuse treatment.
    Court hearings are held to review the case and determine appropriate actions.`
